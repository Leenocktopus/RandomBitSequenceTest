**RandomBitSequenceTest**

Library of statistical tests comprises of 15 tests developed by NIST and 8 multidimensional statistic tests.

The main goal of the library, is to provide an estimate of randomness of a sequence created by RNG.

NIST tests give adequate results only if sequence length is more than 100, while use of multidimensional statistics allows for testing short sequences (length < 100).
